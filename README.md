# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Intro
### I recently started learning C++. This is a basic calculator that I have coded using it. It is a work in progress, so don't expect the best from it.

## How to use
### You type in a first number, an operator (+ for addition, - for subtraction, / for division, * for multiplication), and then a second number. It will give you the result and prompt you to enter a first number again. If you enter a zero for any of the numbers, it will exit out.
